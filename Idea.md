**THE BIG PROBLEMS FOR SELF-SUPERVISED LEANRING TO SOLVE**

- Advanced versions of pretext task (_e.g._ a biological plausible manner)? Beyond the two _old fashioned types_:
  (1) hide some components from input data and require the model to reconstruct them and
  (2) generate some meaningful pseudo labels and require the model to predict them.
- What else can self-supervised learning to for us? Beyond robustness, or *un-measurable* generalization ability.
- TODO
